# ✅✅✅ ALL DONE! ✅✅✅

## 🎉 Terraform & CI/CD Fully Configured!

**Date:** October 10, 2024, 9:20 PM IST  
**Status:** ✅ All Issues Fixed!

## ✅ What Just Got Fixed

### Issue 1: CI/CD Pipeline - npm cache error
**Error:** `Dependencies lock file is not found`
**Fix:** Removed `cache: 'npm'` from setup-node (no root package-lock.json)
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Terraform - Resource already exists
**Error:** `A resource with the ID "/subscriptions/***/resourceGroups/studysphere-rg" already exists`
**Fix:** 
- Created Azure Storage account: `studyspheretfstate`
- Migrated Terraform state from local to Azure Storage
- Now state is shared across GitHub Actions runs
**Status:** ✅ Fixed
