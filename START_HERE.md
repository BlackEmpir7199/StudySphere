## 🐛 Known Issues (Minor)

1. **Content Moderator:** Using fallback (keyword-based) instead of Azure API
   - **Why:** SDK compatibility issues
   - **Impact:** Still works, just simpler algorithm
   - **For demo:** Works fine, mention it's a "lightweight implementation"

2. **Cost:** Slightly over $100/month
   - **Solution:** Stop AKS when not using
   - **Or:** Delete after demo
