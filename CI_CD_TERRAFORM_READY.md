# 🎉 CI/CD & Terraform Setup COMPLETE!

## ✅ Everything is Ready!

**Date:** October 10, 2024  
**Status:** 100% Ready for GitHub Deployment

---

## 🎯 What's Been Set Up

### 1. ✅ CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`

**What it does:**
- Builds and tests your code
- Creates Docker images
- Pushes images to ACR
- Deploys to dev/test/prod environments
- Requires manual approval for production

**Features:**
- ✅ Multi-environment deployment (dev → test → prod)
- ✅ Automatic image tagging with commit SHA
- ✅ Secret management for each environment
- ✅ Health checks after deployment
- ✅ Rollout status verification

### 2. ✅ Terraform Infrastructure

**File:** `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`

**What it does:**
- Manages Azure infrastructure as code
- Creates PostgreSQL, ACR, AKS automatically
- Shows plan before making changes
- Requires approval before applying

**Resources Managed:**
- ✅ Resource Group
- ✅ PostgreSQL Flexible Server + Database
- ✅ Azure Container Registry
- ✅ Azure Kubernetes Service (2 nodes)
- ✅ ACR to AKS integration
- ✅ Log Analytics Workspace
- ✅ Ingress Controller installation

### 3. ✅ Configuration Files

**Created/Updated:**
- `infra/main.tf` - Infrastructure definition
- `infra/variables.tf` - Configuration variables
- `infra/outputs.tf` - Output values
- `infra/terraform.tfvars` - Your specific values
- `GITHUB_SETUP.md` - Complete setup guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Verification checklist
- `scripts/setup-github-secrets.sh` - Helper script

---

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

**1. Push Code to GitHub:**
```bash
cd C:\Users\Rakhul\Projects\StudySphere

# Initialize git (if not done)
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Complete deployment with CI/CD and Terraform"

# Add your GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/StudySphere.git

# Push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**2. Set Up GitHub Secrets:**

Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

**Essential Secrets to Add:**

```bash
# Azure Service Principal (Create it first!)
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "studysphere-github-actions" \
  --role contributor \
  --scopes /subscriptions/YOUR_SUB_ID/resourceGroups/studysphere-rg \
  --sdk-auth

# Then add these secrets:
AZURE_CREDENTIALS     = <Full JSON output from above>
ARM_CLIENT_ID         = <clientId from JSON>
ARM_CLIENT_SECRET     = <clientSecret from JSON>
ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID   = <subscriptionId from JSON>
ARM_TENANT_ID         = <tenantId from JSON>

# Application Secrets
ACR_NAME              = studysphereacr
ACR_LOGIN_SERVER      = studysphereacr.azurecr.io
AKS_CLUSTER_NAME      = studysphere-aks
AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP    = studysphere-rg
DATABASE_URL          = postgresql://pgadmin:YOUR_PASSWORD@studysphere-postgres.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/studysphere?sslmode=require
DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD     = YOUR_DB_PASSWORD
JWT_SECRET            = YOUR_STRONG_JWT_SECRET
GEMINI_API_KEY        = YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
GEMINI_MODEL          = gemini-2.0-flash-exp
AZURE_MODERATOR_KEY   = YOUR_AZURE_MODERATOR_KEY
AZURE_MODERATOR_ENDPOINT = https://YOUR_MODERATOR_ENDPOINT.cognitiveservices.azure.com/
```

**3. Create GitHub Environments:**

Go to **Settings** → **Environments** → **New environment**

Create these:
- `development` (no protection)
- `testing` (optional: add reviewers)
- `production` (required: add yourself as reviewer)
- `production-infrastructure` (required: add reviewers)
- `production-infrastructure-destroy` (required: strict reviewers)

**4. Enable Workflows:**

- Go to **Actions** tab
- Enable workflows if prompted
- Wait for first workflow to run

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic Deployment Flow

```
1. You push code to 'main' branch
        ↓
2. GitHub Actions triggered automatically
        ↓
3. Build and Test job runs
        ↓
4. Docker images built and pushed to ACR
        ↓
5. Deployed to Development (automatic)
        ↓
6. Deployed to Testing (needs approval)
        ↓
7. Deployed to Production (needs approval)
        ↓
8. ✅ Live at http://20.249.205.162
```

### Terraform Infrastructure Flow

```
1. You change files in infra/ folder
        ↓
2. Push to GitHub
        ↓
3. Terraform Plan runs automatically
        ↓
4. Shows what will change
        ↓
5. You approve
        ↓
6. Terraform Apply creates resources
        ↓
7. ✅ Infrastructure updated
```

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### 1. Check Workflows Created

Go to **Actions** tab in GitHub. You should see:
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Terraform Infrastructure

### 2. Check Current Deployment

Your app is already deployed manually:
```bash
# Check it's running
kubectl get pods -n production
kubectl get ingress -n production

# Visit
start http://20.249.205.162
```

### 3. Test CI/CD Pipeline

```bash
# Make a small change
echo "# Test CI/CD" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: CI/CD pipeline"
git push

# Go to Actions tab and watch it run!
```
