## 📋 What YOU Need to Do (10 Minutes)

### Step 1: Add GitHub Secrets (5 min)

**Open this file:** `GITHUB_SECRETS_LIST.txt`

**Go to:** https://github.com/BlackEmpir7199/StudySphere/settings/secrets/actions

**For each secret (16 total):**
1. Click "New repository secret"
2. Copy "Name" from the file
3. Copy "Value" from the file
4. Click "Add secret"

**Progress:** 0/16 → 16/16 ✅

---

### Step 2: Create GitHub Environments (3 min)

**Go to:** https://github.com/BlackEmpir7199/StudySphere/settings/environments

**Create these 5:**

1. **development**
   - Click "New environment"
   - Name: `development`
   - Click "Configure environment" → Save

2. **testing**
   - Name: `testing`
   - (Optional) Add reviewers
   - Save

3. **production**
   - Name: `production`
   - ✅ Check "Required reviewers" → Add yourself
   - ✅ Deployment branches → Only `main`
   - Save

4. **production-infrastructure**
   - Name: `production-infrastructure`
   - ✅ Add yourself as reviewer
   - Save

5. **production-infrastructure-destroy**
   - Name: `production-infrastructure-destroy`
   - ✅ Add yourself as reviewer
   - Save

---

### Step 3: Verify (2 min)

**Go to:** https://github.com/BlackEmpir7199/StudySphere/actions

**You should see:**
- ✅ CI/CD Pipeline workflow
- ✅ Terraform Infrastructure workflow

**Test (optional):**
```bash
echo "# Test CI/CD" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: Trigger workflows"
git push origin main
```

Watch it deploy automatically! 🚀

   ```
   git push → GitHub Actions → Build → Deploy → Live!
   ```

2. ✅ **Infrastructure as Code**
   ```
   Change infra/ → Push → Terraform Plan → Approve → Applied!
   ```

3. ✅ **Multi-Environment**
   ```
   Dev → Test → Production (with approvals)
   ```

4. ✅ **Production-Grade DevOps**
   - All industry best practices
   - Documented and automated
   - Ready for presentation!

## 🎓 For Your Presentation

**What to Say:**

> "I've built StudySphere, a production-grade study platform deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service. The infrastructure is fully managed as code using Terraform, which I imported from my existing deployment showing zero configuration drift. I've implemented a complete CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions that automatically builds, tests, and deploys across dev, test, and production environments with manual approval gates. The application uses Kubernetes Ingress for intelligent API routing across 4 microservices, integrates Google Gemini AI for quiz classification and resource summarization, and handles real-time communication with Socket.io."

**Key Points:**
1. ✅ Terraform - Infrastructure as Code (imported existing, zero drift)
2. ✅ GitHub Actions - Full CI/CD pipeline
3. ✅ Kubernetes - Ingress controller, 11 pods, 2 nodes
4. ✅ Azure - PostgreSQL, ACR, AKS
5. ✅ AI - Google Gemini integration
6. ✅ Real-time - Socket.io chat
7. ✅ Production-ready - All best practices
