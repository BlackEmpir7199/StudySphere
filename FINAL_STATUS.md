## 🐛 Issue That Was Just Fixed

### Problem: 401 Unauthorized on Quiz Submission

**Error you saw:**
```
POST http://4.230.64.247/api/profile/quiz 401 (Unauthorized)
```

**Root cause:**  
JWT cookies were set with `secure: true`, which requires HTTPS. Since we're using HTTP with a public IP (4.230.64.247), browsers weren't sending the cookie.

**Fix applied:**
Changed cookie settings in `shared/utils/auth.js`:
```javascript
res.cookie('token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: false,  // ← Changed from true
  sameSite: 'lax',
  maxAge: 7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
  path: '/',      // ← Added explicit path
});
```

**Deployed:**
- Rebuilt auth-service → v4
- Rebuilt user-service → v4
- Pushed to ACR
- Updated Kubernetes deployments
- **Status:** ✅ Running
