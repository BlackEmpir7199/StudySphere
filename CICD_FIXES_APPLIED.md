## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Deprecated Artifact Action ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
This request has been automatically failed because it uses a deprecated version of actions/upload-artifact: v3
```

**Fix:**
- Updated `actions/upload-artifact@v3` → `v4`
- Updated `actions/download-artifact@v3` → `v4`
- Applied in both ci-cd.yml and terraform.yml

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

### Issue 2: Missing npm Cache File ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
Dependencies lock file is not found in /home/runner/work/StudySphere/StudySphere. 
Supported file patterns: package-lock.json,npm-shrinkwrap.json,yarn.lock
```

**Root Cause:**
- `setup-node@v4` was configured with `cache: 'npm'`
- No package-lock.json in project root (we have a monorepo)

**Fix:**
```yaml
- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: '18'
    # Removed: cache: 'npm'
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 3: Terraform State Not in GitHub ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
Error: A resource with the ID "/subscriptions/***/resourceGroups/studysphere-rg" already exists
```

**Root Cause:**
- Terraform state was local on your machine
- GitHub Actions couldn't see the imported resources
- Tried to create resources that already exist

**Fix:**
1. Created Azure Storage account: `studyspheretfstate`
2. Created blob container: `tfstate`
3. Migrated local state to Azure Storage
4. Updated `infra/backend.tf`:
```hcl
terraform {
  backend "azurerm" {
    resource_group_name  = "studysphere-rg"
    storage_account_name = "studyspheretfstate"
    container_name       = "tfstate"
    key                  = "production.tfstate"
  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed - State now shared!

---

### Issue 4: Namespace Conflicts in Deployment ✅ FIXED
**Error:**
```
the namespace from the provided object "production" does not match the namespace "development"
```

**Root Cause:**
- Deployment YAML files have `namespace: production` hardcoded
- Workflow tried to apply with `-n development`
- Kubernetes rejected the mismatch

**Fix:**
Instead of in-place editing, create temporary directories:
```yaml
- name: Deploy to Development
  run: |
    mkdir -p k8s-dev
    for file in k8s/deployments/*.yaml; do
      cat $file | sed "s|:latest|:${{ github.sha }}|g" | sed "s|namespace: production|namespace: development|g" > k8s-dev/$(basename $file)
    done
    kubectl apply -f k8s-dev/ -n development
```

**Status:** ✅ Fixed
